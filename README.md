# DaggerMVP
A sample project to demonstrate the use of the Dagger-Android Module together with the MVP architectural pattern.

This was done to help me learn the implementation of Dagger-Android + MVP + Kotlin + RxJava2 + Testing. It uses the [Github API](https://api.github.com/search/users?q=location:lagos) to fetch users in a city and goes ahead to fetch user specific details.
